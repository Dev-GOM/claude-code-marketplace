Engage the @bug-hunter agent to systematically find and fix bugs.

## Bug Detection Process:

1. **Identify the Problem**
   - Analyze error messages and stack traces
   - Review recent code changes
   - Check logs and runtime behavior

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Trace the bug to its source
   - Understand why it occurs
   - Identify related issues

3. **Solution Strategy**
   - Propose multiple fix approaches
   - Evaluate trade-offs
   - Choose the best solution

4. **Implementation**
   - Fix the bug with minimal changes
   - Add error handling if needed
   - Ensure backwards compatibility

5. **Validation**
   - Verify the fix resolves the issue
   - Check for side effects
   - Suggest test cases to prevent regression

## What to provide:

- Error messages or logs (if available)
- File path or code snippet where the bug occurs
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Steps to reproduce (if known)

Let's squash this bug! What's the issue?
