**Common Performance Issues and Solutions:**

1. **Excessive Draw Calls** → Enable static batching, combine materials, use GPU instancing
2. **Garbage Collection Spikes** → Avoid allocations in Update, use StringBuilder, cache collections
3. **Inefficient Component Access** → Cache GetComponent calls in Awake/Start
4. **Overdraw and Fill Rate** → Reduce transparent overlays, optimize UI hierarchies
5. **Physics Performance** → Use appropriate collision detection modes, optimize collision matrix

**Optimization Workflow:**

1. **Profile First**
   - Identify actual bottlenecks
   - Measure current performance
   - Use Unity Profiler and Frame Debugger
   - Set target frame budget (16.67ms for 60fps)

2. **Analyze Hotspots**
   - CPU: Scripts, physics, rendering
   - GPU: Shaders, overdraw, vertex processing
   - Memory: Allocations, textures, meshes

3. **Prioritize Optimizations**
   - Focus on biggest impact first
   - Low-hanging fruit (static batching, caching)
   - Platform-specific optimizations
   - Balance quality vs performance

4. **Implement Solutions**
   - Apply one optimization at a time
   - Measure impact after each change
   - Document performance gains
   - Consider trade-offs

5. **Verify Results**
   - Profile again
   - Test on target devices
   - Check for regressions
   - Maintain performance budget

**Performance Checklist:**

**Rendering:**
- ✅ Static objects marked as static
- ✅ Draw calls < 100 (mobile) or < 500 (PC)
- ✅ Textures compressed and power-of-2
- ✅ Materials batched where possible
- ✅ LOD groups for distant objects
- ✅ Occlusion culling enabled
- ✅ Shadow distance optimized
- ✅ Realtime lights minimized

**Scripts:**
- ✅ No GetComponent in Update
- ✅ Object pooling for frequent spawns
- ✅ Event-driven instead of polling
- ✅ Coroutines used appropriately
- ✅ No allocations in hot paths
- ✅ Cached component references
- ✅ Empty Update/FixedUpdate removed

**Physics:**
- ✅ Collision matrix optimized
- ✅ Appropriate collider types
- ✅ Fixed timestep tuned (0.02 default)
- ✅ Auto sync disabled if not needed
- ✅ Raycasts limited per frame

**Memory:**
- ✅ Textures < 2048x2048 (mobile)
- ✅ Audio clips streamed or compressed
- ✅ No memory leaks
- ✅ Asset bundles used for large content
- ✅ Resources unloaded when not needed

**Optimization Patterns:**

- **Object Pooling:** Queue-based pooling to prevent Instantiate/Destroy overhead
- **Cache-Friendly Iteration:** Sequential memory access for better cache performance
- **Component Caching:** Store references to avoid repeated GetComponent calls
- **Event-Driven Updates:** Use events instead of polling in Update loops
